🚀 WebSocket Server for Chrome Extension Communication

This server acts as a bridge between test clients and the Chrome extension,
enabling full round-trip communication for browser automation commands.

🔗 FULL ROUND-TRIP COMMUNICATION PATTERN:
1. Test Client → Server: Sends command with unique ID
2. Server → Extension: Forwards command to Chrome extension
3. Extension → Server: Executes command and sends response
4. Server → Test Client: Routes response back to original client

📡 MESSAGE FLOW:
Test Client (WebSocket) → Server (Port 17892) → Chrome Extension (WebSocket)
Chrome Extension → Server → Test Client

🎯 KEY COMPONENTS:
- CLIENTS: Set of all connected WebSocket clients
- EXTENSION_WS: Reference to the Chrome extension client
- PENDING: Dictionary mapping command IDs to futures for response routing
