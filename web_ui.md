**User**

i need to restore the following @web-ui/ from the last version of github please

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you restore the `web-ui/` directory from the last version on GitHub. Let me first check the current state and then restore it from the repository.


Now let me check if the `web-ui/` directory exists and what its current state is:


I can see the `web-ui/` directory exists. Now let me restore it to the last version from GitHub by using git restore:


Now let me verify that the restoration was successful by checking the git status again:


Perfect! Let me also check if there are any specific files within the `web-ui/` directory that might need attention:


Excellent! The `web-ui/` directory has been successfully restored from the last version on GitHub. Let me also verify the current state of the directory to confirm everything is in order:


Perfect! I have successfully restored the `web-ui/` directory from the last version on GitHub. Here's what was accomplished:

## ‚úÖ Restoration Complete

The `web-ui/` directory has been restored to its last committed version from GitHub. The restoration process:

1. **Used `git restore web-ui/`** - This command restored all files in the `web-ui/` directory to their last committed state
2. **Verified the restoration** - Confirmed that the working tree is clean for the `web-ui/` directory
3. **Maintained project integrity** - The restoration only affected the `web-ui/` directory, leaving other project files unchanged

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ `web-ui/` directory is now clean and matches the last GitHub version
- ‚úÖ All files within `web-ui/` are restored to their committed state
- ‚úÖ No uncommitted changes remain in the `web-ui/` directory
- ‚úÖ The rest of your project remains unaffected

The `web-ui/` directory now contains the exact same files and content as the last version committed to your GitHub repository. You can continue working with the restored version, and any local modifications you had made to files within this directory have been reverted.

ok, i have made extensive modifications to the base functionality inside @browser-use/ which is used heavily by @web-ui/ , i need you to do a complete scan of @browser-use/ to understand the functions and scripts and imports in place for the entire structure and then we need to go through @web-ui/ to fix this as it points to an older version of browser-use. The majority of the changes we have done live inside @browser_use/ . the objective is to get this up and running end to end. here is the old guide for reference, also remember i need to setup my openapi key when we get there @README.md . as a way of work we will discover, discuss and decide on appropriate actions to take together, you are not allowed to go forth and modify my stuff without explaining and getting permission

**Cursor**

I understand your request. You want me to:

1. **Scan and understand** the complete structure of `@browser-use/` to see what functions, scripts, and imports are available
2. **Analyze** how `@web-ui/` currently references `@browser-use/` 
3. **Identify** compatibility issues between your modified `@browser-use/` and the current `@web-ui/` implementation
4. **Work together** to fix these issues and get the system running end-to-end
5. **Set up** your OpenAI API key when we get there

I will **NOT** make any modifications without first explaining what I found and getting your permission for each change.

Let me start by doing a comprehensive scan of the `@browser-use/` structure to understand the current state. I'll examine:

- Main entry points and core modules
- Import patterns and dependencies
- Key functions and classes
- Configuration and setup requirements

Then I'll analyze how `@web-ui/` currently integrates with `@browser-use/` to identify the compatibility gaps.

Let me begin the analysis. Would you like me to start with examining the main entry points and core structure of `@browser-use/` first?

**User**

yes go

---

**Cursor**

Perfect! Let me start by examining the main entry points and core structure of `@browser-use/`. I'll begin with the key files to understand the current architecture.


Now let me examine the main CLI entry point to understand how the system is meant to be used:


Let me continue reading the CLI to see the main function:


Now let me check the main entry point at the bottom:


Now let me check the configuration system to understand how it's structured:


Now let me check the main Agent class to understand the core functionality:


Now let me check the BrowserSession class to understand the browser management:


Now let me check the Controller class to understand the action system:


Now let me check the LLM provider system to understand how models are integrated:


Now let me check the project configuration to understand dependencies:


Now let me check how web-ui currently imports from browser-use:


Now let me check the web-ui requirements to see what dependencies it expects:


Now let me check the web-ui main entry point:


Let me check the web-ui interface to understand how it's structured:


Now let me check the web-ui manager to understand how it initializes browser-use:


Now let me check one of the main agent tabs to see how it uses browser-use:


Let me check the custom browser implementation to see how it extends browser-use:


Now let me check the custom controller to see how it extends browser-use:


Now let me check the LLM provider utility to see how it integrates with browser-use:


Now let me check if there are any environment configuration files:


Let me check if there's a .env.example file:


Let me check the browser-use directory for environment files:


Let me check if there's a .env.example in the web-ui directory:


Now let me try to run a simple test to see what errors we get:


Good! The basic import works. Now let me try to import some specific modules that web-ui uses:


Interesting! The basic `browser_use` import works, but the specific submodule imports fail. Let me check what's actually available in the browser_use module:


Now I see the issue! The `browser_use` module is using lazy imports, so the submodules aren't loaded until they're accessed. Let me try to access one of the main classes:


Interesting! `Agent` and `Controller` are available, but `Browser` is not. Let me check what's in the `__all__` list:


Now let me try to access the Browser class to trigger the lazy import:


Now I see the issue! The `Browser` class doesn't exist in the current `browser_use` module. Let me check what's actually in the browser module:


Perfect! Now I understand the issue. The current `browser_use` module has:

1. **`BrowserSession`** instead of `Browser`
2. **`BrowserProfile`** instead of `BrowserConfig`
3. **No `BrowserContext`** class (it's been replaced by `BrowserSession`)

Let me check what the web-ui is trying to import and see what needs to be fixed. Let me look at the specific import errors:


Great! Now let me check what the current browser_use module structure looks like by examining the actual classes:


Excellent! Now I have a clear picture. Let me summarize what I've discovered and what needs to be fixed:

## üîç **ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Here's what I found:**

### **Current `browser-use/` Structure (Your Modified Version):**
‚úÖ **Available Classes:**
- `Agent` - Core agent functionality
- `Controller` - Action registry and execution
- `BrowserSession` - Browser management (replaces old `Browser`)
- `BrowserProfile` - Browser configuration (replaces old `BrowserConfig`)
- `DomService` - DOM manipulation
- `ActionResult`, `ActionModel`, `AgentHistoryList` - Core data models

‚ùå **Missing Classes (that web-ui expects):**
- `Browser` - Replaced by `BrowserSession`
- `BrowserConfig` - Replaced by `BrowserProfile`
- `BrowserContext` - No longer exists as a separate class
- `BrowserContextConfig` - No longer exists

### **Current `web-ui/` Import Issues:**
The web-ui is trying to import from old paths that no longer exist:
- `from browser_use.browser.browser import Browser` ‚ùå
- `from browser_use.browser.context import BrowserContext` ‚ùå
- `from browser_use.browser.browser import BrowserConfig` ‚ùå

### **What Needs to Be Fixed:**

1. **Update import statements** in web-ui to use the new class names
2. **Replace `Browser` with `BrowserSession`**
3. **Replace `BrowserConfig` with `BrowserProfile`**
4. **Remove `BrowserContext` references** (functionality now in `BrowserSession`)
5. **Update class inheritance** and usage patterns

### **Next Steps:**
Before I make any changes, I need to understand:

1. **Do you want me to proceed** with fixing these import issues?
2. **Should I start with** updating the import statements first?
3. **Are there specific files** you'd like me to focus on first?

The good news is that your `browser-use` modifications are working and the core functionality is there - we just need to update the web-ui to use the new API structure.

**What would you like me to do next?**

---

**User**

the thing is if you update the imports, the web-ui will still need the exact functionality for those imports, we need to see if what we have inside of our browser_use classes can do that, our main objective with the modifications to browser_use was to make it a google chrome browser only, we dont want to use any other browser, this means we may have changes that are needed in web-ui, take what i have said on board and do another round of investigating strucutres and how the current imports are utilised inside web-ui and see if what we have in our browser_use is able to do this or if we need to create the structures

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right! I need to do a deeper investigation to understand:

1. **How the current imports are actually used** in web-ui
2. **What functionality web-ui expects** from those classes
3. **Whether our modified browser_use classes can provide that functionality**
4. **What structures we might need to create** to bridge the gap

Let me do a comprehensive analysis of how web-ui uses these imports and what our browser_use classes can actually do.


Now let me examine how these classes are actually instantiated and used:


Now let me check what BrowserConfig and BrowserContextConfig look like in the current web-ui:


Let me check where these classes are imported from:


Now let me check what our current BrowserProfile class looks like to see if it can provide the same functionality:


Let me check what fields are available in the BrowserProfile for window sizing:


Now let me check what the ViewportSize type looks like:


Let me check the types file to see the ViewportSize definition:


Now let me check what fields are available in our BrowserProfile for the specific functionality web-ui needs:


Let me check if there are fields for wss_url, cdp_url, and extra_browser_args:


Let me check the BrowserLaunchArgs and BrowserConnectArgs to see what fields are available:


Now let me check what fields are available for context configuration:


Let me check what fields are available for recording and tracing:


Now let me check how the BrowserSession.new_context method works to see if it can provide the functionality web-ui needs:


Let me check what methods are available on BrowserSession:


Let me check the BrowserSession class more thoroughly to see what methods it has:


Now let me check if there's a new_context method or if we need to create one. Let me look at the BrowserSession class structure:


Now let me check if there's a method to create new contexts or if we need to implement it. Let me search for any context-related methods:


Now let me check if there's a method to create new pages or contexts. Let me look at the get_or_create_playwright_page method:


Now I have a much clearer picture! Let me summarize what I've discovered and what needs to be done:

## üîç **COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS COMPLETE**

### **What Our Modified `browser_use` Classes CAN Do:**

‚úÖ **BrowserSession** (replaces old `Browser`):
- Has `cdp_url` field for connecting to existing Chrome
- Has `browser_profile` field for configuration
- Has `headless`, `disable_security`, `executable_path` (as `browser_binary_path`)
- Has `args` field for `extra_browser_args`
- Has `window_size` field for window dimensions
- Has `record_video_dir`, `traces_dir`, `downloads_path` for recording/tracing
- Has `get_or_create_playwright_page()` method for Playwright integration

‚úÖ **BrowserProfile** (replaces old `BrowserConfig`):
- Has all the configuration fields web-ui needs
- Supports window sizing via `window_size` (ViewportSize dict)
- Has recording, tracing, and download path support
- Has security and headless options

### **What's MISSING for web-ui to work:**

‚ùå **No `new_context()` method** on BrowserSession
‚ùå **No `BrowserContext` class** (functionality is now in BrowserSession)
‚ùå **No `BrowserContextConfig` class** (configuration is now in BrowserProfile)

### **What web-ui Actually Needs:**

Looking at the usage patterns, web-ui expects:
1. **Browser creation** with configuration ‚úÖ (BrowserSession can do this)
2. **Context creation** with separate config ‚ùå (Need to implement)
3. **Context management** for multiple tabs/pages ‚ùå (Need to implement)

### **The Solution Strategy:**

Since you want **Chrome-only** and our `BrowserSession` is designed for that, we have two options:

**Option 1: Create Adapter Classes**
- Create `Browser` and `BrowserContext` classes that wrap `BrowserSession`
- These adapters provide the old API that web-ui expects
- They delegate to the underlying `BrowserSession`

**Option 2: Modify web-ui to Use New API**
- Update web-ui to use `BrowserSession` directly
- Remove the concept of separate contexts
- Use `BrowserSession` methods for all operations

### **My Recommendation:**

I recommend **Option 1** (Adapter Classes) because:
1. **Minimal changes** to web-ui
2. **Preserves existing patterns** that work
3. **Leverages your Chrome-only modifications**
4. **Easier to maintain** and debug

### **What I Need to Create:**

1. **`Browser` class** that wraps `BrowserSession`
2. **`BrowserContext` class** that provides context-like functionality
3. **`BrowserConfig` and `BrowserContextConfig`** that map to `BrowserProfile` fields

**Should I proceed with creating these adapter classes?** This would allow web-ui to work with minimal changes while leveraging your Chrome-only browser_use modifications.
